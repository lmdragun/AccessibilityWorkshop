# Accessibility Workshop

This is a workshop for those wanting to see how accessibility concerns are reflected in code.

##Steps:

* Each Exercise is a "find all" of accessibility issues to be fixed

* If you do not know the solution for an issue, but know it *is* an issue, just make note of it and look at the solution file later. Knowing something is an issue is the most important step.

* Only one solution for a problem is reflected in the solution file, that does not mean only one is correct

* Some accessibility practices don't have set solutions, but are based on preference, UX, or other concerns

## Requirements:
### A way to edit HTML and CSS

- Your code editor of choice
- If on a Windows machine, Notepad will work
- If on a Mac, TextEdit can be configured to work: <https://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-configure-textedit-for-coding-html--mac-44786>
- If you have tried coding on a Mac before, you may have XCode already installed
- Otherwise, you will most likely have to install a code editor

### Basic HTML and CSS knowledge (Javascript for later exercises)

## Note:
The code is made to be as simple as possible, at the moment it is not responsive.

The "solution" section is not meant to be the final say in accessibility, but contain answers to the problems we address in the workshop.
