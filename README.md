Slides: <https://slides.com/lmdragun/accessibility-workshop/>

Requirements: A way to edit HTML, CSS, and (if doing beyond Exercise 1) Javascript.

- If on a Windows machine, Notepad will work.
- If on a Mac, TextEdit can be configured to work: <https://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-configure-textedit-for-coding-html--mac-44786>
- If you have tried coding on a Mac before, you may have XCode already installed.
- Otherwise, you will most likely have to install a code editor.
