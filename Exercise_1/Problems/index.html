          <p>Remus is an awesome little guy. He is a 15 year old tweenie dachshund. He was the runt of the litter, so he's not as "regal" or "long" as he could be, but I think he's perfect!</p>

          <p>His favorite activities are sleeping, cuddling, rolling on his back to look cute so he gets more cuddles, and digging a complicated network of tunnels in my parents' backyard to hunt for moles.</p>

          <p>When he was younger, he gave us a real scare--he suddenly developed a back problem and had to go in for emergency back surgery...during a blizzard. We were told he'd never walk again.</p>

          <p>But he does walk now, though one of his legs only works from the hip-up. And when he runs, he bunny hops! He also <em>loves</em> to swim (though he is convinced hoses are his natural enemy, so they better watch out!).</p>
